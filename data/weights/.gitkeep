# This file ensures the weights/ directory is tracked by Git
#
# This directory is used for:
# - Trained machine learning models (sklearn, pytorch, tensorflow)
# - Model checkpoints and saved states
# - Feature scaling parameters (scalers, encoders)
# - Neural network weights and architectures
# - Cross-validation model artifacts
# - Hyperparameter optimization results
