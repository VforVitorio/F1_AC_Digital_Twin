    "\n",
    "### **🎯 Primary Goals:**\n",
    "- **Analyze telemetry data** from Assetto Corsa's built-in AI to understand optimal driving patterns\n",
    "- **Prepare feature sets** for Behavioral Learning model training\n",
    "- **Identify key variables** for model input/output: `Throttle`, `Brake`, `Steering`, `Gear`\n",
    "- **Validate data quality** and detect anomalies that could affect model performance\n",
    "\n",
    "### **📋 Analysis Scope:**\n",
    "- **Control Variables Analysis**: Deep dive into throttle, brake, steering, and gear patterns\n",
    "- **Contextual Variables**: Speed, RPM, position, and environmental factors\n",
    "- **Temporal Patterns**: Lap-by-lap progression and consistency analysis  \n",
    "- **Feature Engineering**: Create derived variables for enhanced model performance\n",
    "- **Data Quality Assessment**: Outlier detection and missing data strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🎮 BL Model Context:**\n",
    "This EDA focuses on preparing data for a **Behavioral Learning model** that will:\n",
    "- **Learn from Assetto Corsa's AI** behavior patterns as a reliable baseline\n",
    "- **Clone and improve** upon the existing AC AI driving capabilities\n",
    "- **Predict control actions** (`Throttle`, `Brake`, `Steering`, `Gear`) based on car state\n",
    "- **Serve as foundation** for our own enhanced AI implementation\n",
    "- **Leverage simulator AI** as high-quality training data source\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🏎️ Data Source Justification:**\n",
    "- **AC's built-in AI** provides consistent, optimized driving patterns\n",
    "- **Simulator environment** offers controlled, repeatable conditions\n",
    "- **High-quality baseline** from professionally tuned racing AI\n",
    "- **Foundation for improvement** rather than starting from scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "### **📈 Expected Outcomes:**\n",
    "- Clean, validated dataset ready for BL model training\n",
    "- Feature importance ranking and selection recommendations\n",
    "- AI behavior insights and pattern analysis\n",
    "- Data preprocessing pipeline for future sessions"
